1.  % Senior Citizens - There are only 16% of the customers who are senior citizens. 
Thus most of our customers in the data are younger people.

2.  As we can see from this graph most of the customers are in the month to month contract. 
While there are equal number of customers in the 1 year and 2 year contracts.

3.  Churn vs Tenure: As we can see form the below plot, the customers who do not churn,
 they tend to stay for a longer tenure with the telecom company.

iv.) Churn by Monthly Charges: Higher % of customers churn when the monthly charges are high.

v.) Churn by Total Charges: It seems that there is higer churn when the total charges are lower.


The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
